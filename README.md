# MOCAP PROJECT


## Credits
This project is based on previous work made by Team Dream for the course Advanced Projects in Interactive Media Technology, HT2022, KTH. The group consisted of four KTH Students: Marcus Holmberg, Måns Nyman, Léa Prémont, Mahmoud Sherzad. Their original code can be found at: https://github.com/MarcusHolmbrg/TeamDreamMocapProject

The work was modified by Alexander Danielsson for the course Advanced Topics in Visualization and Computer Graphic, HT2022, KTH, to allow for simultaneous playback of multiple motion capture data, as well as different visualization techniques for this.
